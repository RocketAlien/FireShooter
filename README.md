Firebase in Unity sample
==========================

This sample demonstrates how to use Firebase inside unity to create a very simple Android game.
The game contains the player ship at the bottom of the screen along with a mirror image of that ship at the top.

Every time the player moves (using touch), the playercontroller updates it's position in Firebase.
The mirror image then uses this information stored in Firebase to move itself.
